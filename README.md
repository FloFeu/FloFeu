Hello ✌️! My name is Florent, I used to be a baker, and now I'm learning web development. 
I'm 27 and live near Paris.
You can find here most of the projects I worked on while learning web dev. 

🌱 I’m currently working on a project aiming to create a database to keep tracks on the video games I played, allowing me to learn Vue deeper.🌱

I intend to learn React after I'm done with my project.
